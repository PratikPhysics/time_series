# 📈 Gold Price Forecasting Using Time Series (ARIMA & SARIMA)

This project performs a time series analysis and forecasting on monthly gold price data using **ARIMA** and **SARIMA** models. It also includes a fully interactive **Streamlit web application** to visualize forecasts.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Data Source**: Gold futures data from Yahoo Finance (`GC=F`)
- **Time Frame**: January 2005 – July 2025
- **Models Used**:
  - ARIMA: Non-seasonal model
  - SARIMA: Seasonal ARIMA model
- **Decomposition**: STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess)
- **Forecast Horizon**: User-selectable (1–36 months)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib + Streamlit

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/time_series_gold_forecasting.git
cd time_series_gold_forecasting
````

### 2. Install Required Packages

Use pip or create a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Streamlit App Locally

```bash
streamlit run app.py
